This repository contains my contribution to the **Zagha Lab** at the University of California, Riverside. Under the guidance of PhD candidate **Dominic Garcia**, this analysis was developed as part of an ongoing project investigating **predictive processing** and **selective sensory filtering** in mice using widefield calcium imaging.

I am a graduate student in the **UCR Biomedical Sciences Master's Program**, and I joined the Zagha Lab in **September 2024**.

## My Contributions

- Conducted computational neuroscience research on predictive coding and cortical sensory filtering
- Applied **machine learning methods** including:
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- Performed **stereotaxic surgeries** for headpost implantation
- Trained mice on **behavioral discrimination tasks**
- Utilized **widefield calcium imaging** to capture cortical dynamics
- Designed and implemented MATLAB workflows for:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Encoding and statistical analysis (repeated measures ANOVA, mixed-effects models)
  - Scientific visualization for presentations and publications
